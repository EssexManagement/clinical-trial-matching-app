This will sort the trials that occur the most often across the different matching services (as we can expect there to be some overlap). The trials that occur the most, are ranked more importantly and thus are `sliced` from highest ranking (most overlap) up to `resultsMax`.

If all trial occurrences are 1, then the `trialCounts` is empty.
