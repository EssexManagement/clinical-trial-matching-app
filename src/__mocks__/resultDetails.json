Women are\r\n             considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12\r\n             months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g.\r\n             age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral\r\n             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.\r\n             In the case of bilateral oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the\r\n             woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not\r\n             of child bearing potential. Highly effective contraception methods include:\r\n\r\n          -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the\r\n             patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation\r\n             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\r\n\r\n          -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without\r\n             hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking\r\n             study treatment.

Note: While oral\r\n             contraceptives are allowed, they should be used in conjunction with a barrier method\r\n             of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.\r\n\r\n          -  For Arm A only: patients who have received prior fulvestrant.\r\n\r\n          -  For Arm C only: h/o of intolerable toxicity to CDK 4/6 inhibitor resulting in\r\n             treatment discontinuation due to toxicity",
